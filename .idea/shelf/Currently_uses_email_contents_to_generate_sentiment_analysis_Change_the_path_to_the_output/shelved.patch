Then you should consider taking a course during Summer Sessions 2017!\r\n\r\nSession 1 begins on May 22 and it’s the perfect opportunity to start your SUNY Oswego journey.\r\n\r\nBy taking a summer course, you’re “jump-starting” your education at Oswego and earning credit toward your degree!

Note:  Enrollment will be dependent upon seat availability.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in taking an online course, you will need to be registered at least one week prior to the start of the course so that we can ensure you get access to it prior to the start of the course.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about this opportunity, including the cost of a summer course, visit Start With Summer!
