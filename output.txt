Hi Andrew,
I'd be happy to help. We'll need to set up a phone call so we can review
the process. What is the best number to reach you and perhaps the best time
to reach you?

Thanks,
Corie

Title: Re: Self Registration
Mon May 08 11:37:09 EDT 2017


Hi Andrew,
I had you scheduled for a call last Thursday at 2 but I was called to an
unexpected meeting. I just called and left a message. I promise we'll get
connected so I can go over the Self Registration information with you. I'm
generally here until 4 or 4:30 but if you want to provide a few other
times/days that I could reach out to you that would be great too.

Thanks,
Corie

Title: Jump-Start Your Academic Career at SUNY Oswego
Mon May 08 16:33:26 EDT 2017


Dear Andrew,

Would you like to get a jump-start on your SUNY Oswego college career?  Then you should consider taking a course during Summer Sessions 2017!

Session 1 begins on May 22 and it’s the perfect opportunity to start your SUNY Oswego journey.

By taking a summer course, you’re “jump-starting” your education at Oswego and earning credit toward your degree!  It is another way SUNY Oswego is making it easier for incoming transfer students to make progress on their SUNY Oswego degree.  Note:  Enrollment will be dependent upon seat availability.

If you are interested in taking an online course, you will need to be registered at least one week prior to the start of the course so that we can ensure you get access to it prior to the start of the course.

To learn more about this opportunity, including the cost of a summer course, visit Start With Summer! (https://www.oswego.edu/summer/start-summer-2017)

Title: Transfer Orientation Social Media
Thu Jul 06 10:58:09 EDT 2017


Good afternoon Andrew,

Now that orientation is just around the corner, let me say welcome to
Oswego on behalf of transfer services! I wanted to send you an email to
introduce myself and offer you a few more resources to help you transition
to Oswego in the fall. My name is Ashley and I'm one of the social media
interns working with transfer services this year, along with Ryan
Rodriguez.

This summer, we'll be doing Q&A's, live tweets, and creating virtual tours
of the campus to help give you an idea of what Oswego is *really *like. So
make sure to connect with us on Twitter
<https://oswego-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/Redirect?ukey=1PFJl1BNxbMJCnxr_1HyWxRU50cjJl0c2iQEOG6dgZJE-0&key=YAMMID-53089679&link=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FOswegoTransfer>

We'll
even be posting about events in the fall that are specifically for transfer
students to help you meet other students who are in the same boat as you.

We'll be at the transfer center table during "Cruising the Campus" at
orientation, so swing by and say hi. And, of course, don't forget to post
about your orientation experiences while you're here and use the hashtag
"TransferOswego."
Best,
Ashley

I am unsure of the fire codes for whatever rooms I am in, but I would not
mind if you attended one when enrolled in the other.  It is very likely
that you can make it official during the first week of classes.  Keep a
close eye on enrollment.

people holding candles - it was such a great way to be welcomed to Oswego. It was
like everyone was saying, "You're part of our Laker Family! We participated in games
and activities and won a TON of free swag and prizes. I would definitely encourage
all students to take advantage of the Opening Week events - especially commuting
