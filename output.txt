CedricJust send your transcripts for all courses - college and AP - and they willdetermine what courses fit here.  If there is a question in the futureregarding that course you should have a syllabus to show the mathdepartment and ask them to evaluate the course.Glad that you sent all to Oswego now and have a great weekend!SueOn Fri Jul 8 2016 at 11:21 AM Cedric Hansen <chansen@oswego.edu> wrote:> Hi Ms Witmer>> I have one more questions regarding classes and credits.

Hi Ms WitmerI have one more questions regarding classes and credits. Will I get credit for linear algebra that I took at Carleton this past year? I looked through the course catalog at Oswego and it's exactly what's described in matrix algebra. Also I just sent my AP scores to Oswego and they should be there within the next week or two. BestCedricSent from my iPhone

Title: SUNY Oswego Math placement for Computer Science and Software Engineering
Wed Jun 22 18:50:23 EDT 2016

AFTER REGEX FILTER:
Dear incoming majorWelcome to the SUNY Oswego Computer Science department! Most of the information you need to attend Oswego will come from the Summer Orientation program and Admissions office. But here's a note on how Oswego Math placement policies impact Computer Science (CS) and Software Engineering (SE) majors.These programs include math requirements reflecting their role in analysis (understanding how and why software works) in support of construction (designing and programming software). There are three categories of math requirements:1. Continuous math: MAT210 (calculus I) and MAT220 (calculus II) that extend ideas from algebra and geometry to dynamic systems.2. Discrete math: MAT215 (discrete) and CSC221 (foundations) that cover logic proofs (MAT215) sets graphs and automata (CSC221).3. Probability and statistics: MAT318 (statistics for sciences) or MAT354 (math statistics) -- optional in CS-BA program required in CS-BS and SE-BS.The ALEKS placement exam (or incoming course credit or waivers) applies to the first Continuous math category. The first two computer science department major courses (CSC212 and CSC241) do not require calculus as prerequisites. Depending on your interests in computing you may or may not not apply continuous math a lot but in any case when you need it you need it. We've found over the years that entering CS and SE students who take MAT210 and/or MAT220 during their first year are more successful. There are additional optional math courses with MAT210 prerequisites; for example Matrix Algebra is a prerequisite for the Computer Graphics course. Also calculus is a pre- or co-requisite for other STEM courses that you may need or want to take including PHY112 required in the SE-BS major.To give you a better idea how these fit in with other major requirements here's an ideal course sequence for the shared core requirements across CS and SE programs. It is possible to complete these in four semesters (leaving electives and SE major or CS track requirements from there on) but some students spread them out further sometimes taking electives they are eligible for before completing core. (Transfer students usually take courses in about the same order adjusting for accepted incoming credit.)  Normally students also take one math course per semester during the the first four semesters but the details depend on initial placement that may impact decisions about which CS courses to take.1. CSC212 (CS 1)2. CSC241 (CS 2) CSC221 (Foundations)3. CSC344 (Programming languages) CSC365 (Algorithms)4. CSC380 (Intro SE) either CSC322 (Systems) or CSC222 (Computer Organization)F you have not taken the ALEKS placement exam or arranged for course credit or waivers please do so as soon as you can. Otherwise you might not get assigned to courses that allow smooth progress through your major.If you placed in a lower-level math course than you expected please take advantage of the online modules that allow you to catch up on topics you might have forgotten or missed learning and then retake the exam (up to 3 times). Putting in some time now may avoid being a semester behind where you want to be in meeting requirements. See https://www.oswego.edu/advisement/math-placement-1 for details about course sequences for given initial scores and placements. If you become unsure about committing to a CS or SE major because of placement results please talk to advisors during Summer Orientation.ALEKS testing and placement are handled by the Summer Orientation program not by the Computer Science department. For more information please click on the "New Student Menu" at https://www.oswego.edu/myoswego/ . But if you have further questions that they cannot help with please contact me and I'll make sure you find answers.SincerelyDoug LeaChair Computer Science Department
